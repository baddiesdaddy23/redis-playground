##Summary of Improvements 

The patched version introduces major functional, usability, and code quality upgrades. Key highlights include state persistence (so you don't lose your work), a fully functional and configurable persistence layer (AOF/RDB), and a vastly improved terminal with command history and autocomplete.

*üöÄ Major Feature Enhancements*
State Persistence: The entire Redis store (all data types) and persistence settings (AOF/RDB) are now saved to localStorage. Your data and settings will persist even after refreshing the page.

Configurable RDB Snapshots: The RDB (Redis Database) snapshot logic is no longer random.

It is now correctly tied to a write operation counter (writesSinceLastSnapshot).

You can now configure the interval (e.g., "snapshot every 10 write ops") using the new input field.

Expanded Command Support: Added several crucial and useful commands that were missing:

EXISTS key [key ...] - Check if one or more keys exist.

TYPE key - Get the data type of a key.

PERSIST key - Remove the Time-To-Live (TTL) from a key.

SCAN cursor [MATCH pattern] - A safe, cursor-based alternative to KEYS for iterating the keyspace.

HELP [COMMAND] - Get specific help for a single command.

CLEAR - A playground-only helper to clear the terminal output.

Updated Command Reference: The "Quick Reference" panel in the UI has been updated to include all these new commands.

‚ú® User Experience (UX) & Usability
Command History: You can now use the Up and Down arrow keys in the terminal to cycle through your command history.

Command Autocomplete:

Tab Completion: Pressing the Tab key will autocomplete the command you are typing (e.g., HSE -> HSET ).

Command List: The input is now linked to a <datalist> for a dropdown of all available commands.

Accessibility: Added a @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) query to disable all animations and transitions for users who require it.

Better Hints: The terminal now includes a "Tips" section explaining the new history, autocomplete, HELP, and CLEAR features.

üêû Bug Fixes & Corrected Logic
Accurate AOF (Append-Only File) Logic: The AOF now correctly logs only write commands (e.g., SET, LPUSH, HDEL). The original version incorrectly logged all commands, including read commands like GET.

Improved Ops/sec Metric: The "Operations/sec" counter no longer shows a spiky, inaccurate value. It now uses a 10-second sliding window to provide a stable and accurate 10-second average (avg) OPS.

Deterministic RDB Logic: As noted above, the RDB trigger is now correctly based on a configurable write counter, not a random number.

üßπ Code Quality & Best Practices
Modern Event Handling: Removed all inline onclick="..." attributes from the HTML. Replaced them with a single, efficient delegated event listener on the main visualization panel. This is cleaner, more performant, and properly separates JavaScript from the markup.

Better Abstraction: Introduced helper functions like setToggleUI to reduce code duplication and make the logic for updating the persistence buttons clearer and easier to maintain.
